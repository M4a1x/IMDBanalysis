To-Do:
* show source in notebook code


Questions:
* Define the concepts
* Define workflows (import, process, visualize, ...)
* Code I need to  write, libraries I can use.
* How to present?


Steps:
1. Clean Data
2. Combine data in meaningful way
Limit to movies with x reviews?
3a. Look for correlations. e.g. rating with others, budget, ...
3b. Produce some visualizations
  - most rated movies
  - rating distribution
  - genre vs rating
  - timeline of certain movies (current top100?) rating, ...
  - duration vs rating
  - best directors? director and rating?
  - best actors? actor and rating?
  - release year vs rating
  - budget vs rating
  - budget vs gross
  - number of reviews/votes vs rating
  - number and budgaet of movies per year
  - number of reviews correlation to number of votes
  - gross vs reviews
  - correlation of keywords to rating/gross/number of votes -> find keywords that every good movie has
  - draw links between movies, link database
4. Predict rating of new movies
  - with keywords, genre, budget, director
  - Personalized score. Predict how much I will like a movie based on movies I rated/liked before.

Questions
What kind of movies get the most gross to budget coefficient?
What movies make the most money?
What makes a good movie?
Can we predict the features/themes of a good selling movie (like keywords)?
Can we predict the rating/revenue for a given movie genre, actors, director, etc?

Goals:
* Learn Python
* Learn about different libraries to work with datasets, visualization, ...
* Learn about statistical significance, correlation, variance in a dataset
* Introduction to Machine Learning and basic categorization and prediction


Libraries:
* SQLAlchemy, SQLObject, (urllib2)[deprecated] => requests
